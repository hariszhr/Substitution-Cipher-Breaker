An important way to understand Trump and Trumpism is as an assault on reality. At issue is the attempt to control, to own, immediate truth along with any part of history that feeds such truth. Since this behavior stems from Trumpâ€™s own mind, it is generally attributed to his narcissism (and he has plenty of that). But I would suggest that the more appropriate term is solipsistic reality. Narcissism suggests self-love and even, in quaint early psychoanalytic language, libido directed at the self. Solipsism has more to do with a cognitive process of interpreting the world exclusively through the experience and needs of the self.

A breach in one single pane of glass would have been immediate
death: nor could anything have preserved the windows, but the strong
lattice wires placed on the outside against accidents in traveling.
I saw the water ooze in at several crannies, although the leaks were
not considerable, and I endeavored to stop them as well as I could.
I was not able to lift up the roof of my closet, which otherwise I
certainly should have done, and sat on the top of it, where I might at
least preserve myself some hours longer than by being shut up, as I
may call it, in the hold. Or, if I escaped these dangers for a day
or two, what could I expect but a miserable death of cold and
hunger! I was four hours under these circumstances, expecting and
indeed wishing every moment to be my last.
